== Tesseract LASAGNA: MVP PWA Framework

=== Concept

*Tesseract LASAGNA* is a fast, modern and modular PHP OOP framework for
rapid prototyping of *Progressive Web Apps* (PWA). Tesseract uses
_Google Sheets CSV exports_ as a data input, it builds the Model from
CSV layers (hence the LASAGNA codename). +
Abstract based *Presenters* are used to process the *Model* and to
export resulting data in TEXT, JSON, XML or HTML5 formats (or any other
custom format). View is built as a set of Mustache templates and
partials (can be also rendered in the browser). +
Tesseract is _Composer components_ based, the Model defines a complex
*RESTful API*, has a _command line interface_ (CLI) and incorporates
_continuous integration_ (CI) testing. +
Tesseract uses no classical database models and structures, so it is
quite easy to implement all types of scaling and integration. The
acccess model is based on the *master key encrypted cookie*.

=== Basic Functionality

==== Index

Tesseract starts parsing the *www/index.php* file, thatâ€™s targeted at
the Apache level via *.htaccess* configuration file using _Mod_rewrite_.
*Index* can contain various constant definitions and overrides. *Index*
then loads the *Boostrap.php* core file from the aplication root folder.

==== Bootstrap

*Bootstrap* sets core constants and the application environment, *Nette
Debugger* is also instantiated on the fly. Bootstrap then loads the
*App.php* core file from the *app/* folder (the location can be
overriden via a constant).

==== App

*App* processes the application configuration files (public and
private), sets caching mechanisms (optional Redis support), configures
URL routing, emmits CSP headers and sets the core *Model*
(multidimensional array). *App* then loads the corresponding _presenter_
based on the actual URI and the coresponding route. It can also run a
_CLI presenter_, if the CLI is detected. +
When the _presenter_ returns an updated Model, the output is echoed and
final headers are set (including some optional debugging information).
Runtime ends here.

==== Presenters

*Presenters* are subclass instances based on an _abstract class_
*APresenter.php* and define at least the _process_ method, that is
called from the *App*. The _process_ method can either output the
resulting data or return it encapsulated inside the Model back to the
*App*

=== Filesystem Hierarchy

* *apache/* - Apache configuration example
* *app/* - Presenters and NE-ON configurations
* *bin/* - bash scripts for Makefile
* *ci/* - Continous Integration logs
* *data/* - private data, encryption keys, CSV imports, etc.
* *doc/* - phpDocumentor generated documentation
* *docker/* - files to be inserted into the Docker container
* *logs/* - system logs
* *node_modules/* - Node.js modules used by Gulp
* *temp/* - temporary files, Mustache compiled templates
* *vendor/* - Composer generated vendor classes
* *www/* - static assets
** *www/cdn-assets/* - repository version hash-links to www/
** *www/css/* - CSS classes
** *www/docs/* - link to doc/
** *www/downloads/* - downloadable files
** *www/epub/* - ePub files
** *www/img/* - images
** *www/js/* - JavaScript files
** *www/partials/* - Mustache partials
** *www/summernote/* - Summernote editor
** *www/templates/* - Mustache templates
** *www/upload/* - uploads via administration panel
** *www/webfonts* - fonts

=== Administration

==== Login and Logout

Tesseract login is based solely on the *Google OAuth 2.0* client right
now. +
When the user logs in, a special encrypted cookie - a master key - is
created and set via HTTPS protocol. This cookie is protected from
tampering and its parameters can be modified in the administration
panel, or remotely via authenticated API calls. +
There is no database of connections or authenticated users at all. The
default login URL is */login* and the default logout URL is */logout*.

==== Permissions

Tesseract has built-in three basic permission levels, that can be easily
extended.

Core levels are: 1) *admin* - superuser, 2) *editor* - can refresh data
and edit articles, 3) *tester* - no elevated permissions, 4)
*authenticated user* - rights the same as level 3, and 5)
*unauthenticated user* - unknown identity.

=== Basic Features

==== Sitemaps

Tesseract generates TXT and XML sitemaps based on the routing tables. +

==== CSP Headers

You can define headers for Content Security Policy within app/csp.neon
file. Feel free to modify our defaults.

=== Extra Features

==== QR Image

The route goes as *qr/[s|m|l|x:size]/[******:trailing]*. The Hello World
example is as follows: [https://lasagna.gscloud.cz/qr/s/Hello%20World]

The size of the QR code is defined as your pair of trousers.
